This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Available Scripts

Download [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone, clone this repo, cd to examples/expo-example-app and install dependencies with `npm install`.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
